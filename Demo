##Initial Project Setup
Create a dedicated folder for your project and organize it with the following structure to ensure it is clean and professional:

FaceAuthSystem/ (Root Directory)

dataset/: This folder will store the images of registered users.

main.py: Your main application script that runs the camera loop.

face_logic.py: The module containing face recognition and authentication logic.

attendance.csv: A file automatically generated to log "Punch-in" and "Punch-out" times.

requirements.txt: A list of all Python libraries needed for the project.

## Prepare the Environment
Before running your code, install the required dependencies using the requirements.txt file you created.

Install Libraries: Open your terminal and run: pip install -r requirements.txt

Verify Hardware: Ensure your webcam is connected and not being used by other applications (like Zoom or Teams).

##Register Users (Enrollment)
To recognize a face, the system needs a reference image.

Take a clear photo of yourself (and any others you want to test).

Save the image in the dataset/ folder.

Important: Rename the image file to the person's name (e.g., Abuzar_Manyar.jpg). The code uses the filename to identify the person.

##Running the Demo
Once the setup is complete, you can start the system.

Execution: Run the command python main.py in your terminal.

Recognition: Look at the camera. A green bounding box should appear around your face with your name.

Action: Press the 'p' key to log your attendance. The terminal should confirm the action, and attendance.csv will be updated.

Exit: Press the 'q' key on your keyboard while focusing on the camera window to stop the program.

but if it doesnt work smoothly after pressing q key you can also click on terminal and then press 'Ctrl' + 'c'
